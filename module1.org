     Libris/ProQuest is actually updating.
   - Data is being maintained by SerSol staff

** Entities in the Knowledgebase 
   
   How is the world of electronic resources modeled in the Serials Solutions
   Knowledgebase?

*** Providers
   #+CAPTION: William S. Hein provider record
   [[./img/HeinProvider.PNG]]

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Providers are the publishers of a database or other electronic resource  
   #+END_NOTES

*** Database
    #+CAPTION: Database record for HeinOnline Law Journal Library
    [[./img/HeinDatabase.PNG]]

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Databases have a relationship to a single provider
    #+END_NOTES

*** Holding
    #+CAPTION: Holding record for AAPG Bulletin in Single Journals
    [[./img/Holding.png]]
    
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Holdings are the individual URLs and chronological coverage that each
    resource has. There is bibliographic data here but that is specific to the
    holding and allows the Knowledgebase to link titles together
    #+END_NOTES

*** Titles

   #+CAPTION: Multiple holdings of same title
   [[./img/DLJHoldings.PNG]]
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - represent the controlled or authoritative version
   #+END_NOTES

*** Model
    #+CAPTION: Entity relationships in the knowledgebase
    [[./img/SerSolModel.png]]

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    + 2 mins
    - explain the cardinality and relationships
    #+END_NOTES
** Knowledgebase Normalization 

   - Serials Solutions ID (SSID)
     - SSJ: Client center title view, MARC records, Management reports: stable!
     - SSIB: MARC reports, management reports: these are unstable!
   - Title ID: holding ID in reports
     - in offline editor, management reports, URLs
   - Databases have identifiers also: called database codes
   - Constantly updating the KB identifying resources that are the same

     #+BEGIN_NOTES
     2 mins
     - give some examples here
     #+END_NOTES

** Exercise
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - ask for an example provider
   - ask for example databases
   - ask for example title
   - ask for example holdings
   - ask why identifiers are important?
   #+END_NOTES

* Updating the KB

  - Continually updating
  - In the support center:
    - [[https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/360_KB/Product_Documentation/General_Content/360_KB%253A_Summary_of_Provider_and_Database_Changes/360_KB%253A_Summary_of_Provider_and_Database_Changes][Summary of Provider and Database Changes]]

** Typical Support Request
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
  - Discover that there is a problem
  - Open a case
  - Monitor that case
  - Follow up as necessary

*** Opening a Case
    - Through the ExL Salesforce Customer Portal
    - Request an account from Perkins
    - Make sure the grants are correct

*** Salesforce
    #+CAPTION: Submitting a case
    [[./img/SalesForce.png]]

*** Tips for Success
    - include as much detail as possible in the original request
    - most data changes have to go to another stage
      - a separate data management team at SerSol

** Local Changes
   What sorts of things do folks here at the Law Library and at Duke
   University Libraries?

*** Activations
    - At the database level
      - subscribed
      - not tracked
      - title coverage: "we only subscribe to some titles"
    - At the holding level "subscribing"
      - Subscribed
      - Not tracked
      #+BEGIN_NOTES
      describe at the database level how you need to make sure the database is
      configured to be all or some
      #+END_NOTES

*** Activations
    - We have some control over the coverage dates
      - This comes from our license information or our agreement
      - There is some specialized formatting to say something like Current
        year only
    - We leave local notes in "shared" databases

** Exercise
* MARC Updates

  - Weekly process
  - Matches the authority versions of journals and ebooks to MARC records
  - separate records for print and online!
  - Records are loaded each week

** Matching
   - Generally the process seems to be based on LCCN
   - Prefer print
   - Will generate a brief record with no match

** Loading
   - Records are loaded on a weekly basis
   - overlap and match based on SSID
   - Records are sorted into brief and full

** MARC Records   
   - 035: SSID: (SSJ or SSIB)
   - 901: SSID: (SSJ or SSIB)
   - 904: Source of Record
   - 915: Database
   - 916: Provider
   - 856: URL

   #+BEGIN_NOTES

   Note when these things change in addition to the description we get an
   updated record.

   But we don't get a new record when URLs change from same holding
